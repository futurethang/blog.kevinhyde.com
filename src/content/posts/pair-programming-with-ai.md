description: What I've learned from coding alongside language models.

Six months ago I started using AI assistants for programming in earnest. Here's what I've learned.

## It's good at the boring parts

Boilerplate, tests, documentation, regex—the stuff that's tedious but necessary. Offloading this frees up mental energy for the parts that actually require thinking.

## It's bad at architecture

Ask it to design a system and you'll get something plausible but generic. The model doesn't know your constraints, your team, your context. High-level design still requires a human who understands the problem deeply.

## The skill is in the prompting

The difference between a useful response and a useless one often comes down to how you frame the question. Being specific about constraints, providing context, asking for multiple approaches—these things matter.

## It makes me a better explainer

To get good output, you have to explain what you want clearly. This has the side effect of forcing me to clarify my own thinking. Sometimes I realize, mid-prompt, that I don't actually know what I want.

The tools will keep getting better. But I suspect the meta-skill—knowing when and how to use them—will remain valuable for a while.
