The weather's turned cold, so the listening has shifted accordingly. A few records that have been on heavy rotation:

**Alice Coltrane — Journey in Satchidananda**
The harp arpeggios on the title track are inexhaustible. I've listened to this record a hundred times and it still surprises me.

**Brian Eno — Ambient 1: Music for Airports**
The obvious choice, but obvious for a reason. Perfect for late afternoon work sessions when the light is fading.

**Pharoah Sanders — Karma**
The flip side of the Coltrane record. "The Creator Has a Master Plan" is 32 minutes long and never feels like enough.

I've been trying to listen more intentionally—one record at a time, start to finish, no skipping. It's harder than it sounds.
