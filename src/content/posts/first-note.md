description: Some thoughts on starting a new notebook.
---

There's something appealing about a blank notebook. The first page is always the hardest—too much potential, too much pressure to begin well.

So I'll begin badly, on purpose. This is just a place to think out loud, to trace the edges of ideas that catch my attention in books and records and conversations.

No grand plans. Just notes.
