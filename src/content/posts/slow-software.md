description: Why I've started to appreciate software that takes its time.

There's a certain kind of software that feels rushed—constantly updating, adding features, chasing trends. And there's another kind that feels considered—stable, focused, deliberately minimal.

I've been gravitating toward the second kind.

## Examples

- **SQLite**: One of the most widely-deployed pieces of software in the world, maintained by a small team that prioritizes stability over features. The documentation is extraordinary.
- **Vim**: Essentially unchanged in its core functionality for decades. The people who use it well have been using it for years.
- **Plain text**: The ultimate stable format. My notes from 2010 are as readable now as they were then.

## The argument

Fast iteration makes sense for consumer products chasing growth. But for tools—things I use every day to do my work—I want reliability over novelty.

Every update is a potential disruption. Every new feature is something else that could break, something else to learn. The best tools disappear into the background and let you focus on your work.

I'm not against progress. But I'm increasingly skeptical of change for its own sake.
